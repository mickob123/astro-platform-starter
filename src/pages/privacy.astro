          <h2>3. AI Processing</h2>
          <p>
            The Service uses artificial intelligence (OpenAI's GPT-4o) to classify, extract, and validate

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Invoice content (email text, PDF documents) is sent to OpenAI's API for processing</li>
            <li>
              We use OpenAI's API with data processing agreements in place. As per OpenAI's API data usage
              policy, data sent via the API is not used to train their models
            </li>
            <li>Extracted data is stored in our secure database for your access and review</li>
          </ul>

              (n8n). These providers are bound by confidentiality obligations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Connected services:</strong> Third-party platforms you choose to integrate
              (Google, Intuit QuickBooks, Slack) as authorised by you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> When required by law, regulation, or legal process, or

          <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
          <p>
            Your data is stored on servers operated by Supabase (cloud infrastructure). While we endeavour
            to use service providers with data centres in Australia where available, some data may be
            processed or stored in overseas locations, including the United States, in connection with
            third-party service providers (e.g., OpenAI, Netlify).
          </p>
          <p>
            In accordance with APP 8, where your data is disclosed to overseas recipients, we take
            reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipient handles your information in accordance
            with the APPs.
          </p>
          <p>We protect your information using:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest</li>
            <li>Row-level security and tenant isolation in our database</li>
            <li>OAuth 2.0 for third-party service authentication (no passwords stored)</li>
            <li>API key hashing (SHA-256) for external integrations</li>
            <li>Role-based access controls</li>
          </ul>

              (e.g., audit logs, legal compliance)
            </li>
          </ul>
